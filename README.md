XRO-SMS-OSINT is an all-in-one phone-number OSINT tool with a fast ImGui interface.
It pulls carrier data, line type, region, linked names, address history, emails, family connections, and other basic profile details — all displayed in a clean, scrollable results panel.

The UI is built on **basic ImGui**, keeping everything lightweight, fast, and extremely reliable even on weaker hardware.

## **What the Tool Does**

When you run a lookup, the tool automatically gathers:

* **Carrier information**

  * Carrier name
  * Line type (mobile/VOIP/etc.)
  * Status
  * Region

* **Identity matches**

  * Linked names
  * Associated profiles

* **Address history**

  * Current address
  * Past addresses (full timeline)

* **Contact details**

  * Emails
  * Linked phone numbers

* **Family connections**

  * Related individuals
  * Associated household records

All results are shown in the two screenshots above — organized into sections you can scroll through easily.
